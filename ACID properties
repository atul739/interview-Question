ACID properties are a set of four key principles that ensure reliability, consistency, and integrity of transactions in a database management system (DBMS).
Let’s break them down 👇

A — Atomicity
	• Definition:
Ensures that a transaction is treated as a single unit of work — it either completes fully or does not happen at all.
	• Example:
Suppose you transfer ₹1000 from Account A to Account B.
		○ Debit ₹1000 from A ✅
		○ Credit ₹1000 to B ✅
If any of these steps fail, the whole transaction is rolled back — no money is deducted or credited.
	• Key phrase: “All or nothing.”

C — Consistency
	• Definition:
Ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another valid state, maintaining data integrity and all defined rules (constraints, triggers, etc.).
	• Example:
After the transfer, the total balance of A + B should remain the same as before.
(If ₹1000 disappears or duplicates, consistency is broken.)

I — Isolation
	• Definition:
Ensures that concurrent transactions execute independently, without affecting each other’s outcome.
	• Example:
Two people transferring money at the same time should not interfere — the database behaves as if each transaction happened one after another.
	• Handled by:
Locking mechanisms and transaction isolation levels (READ COMMITTED, SERIALIZABLE, etc.)

D — Durability
	• Definition:
Once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent, even if the system crashes right after.
	• Example:
After the transfer completes, even a sudden power loss won't revert it.
	• Ensured by:
Writing data to non-volatile storage (like disk logs or database journals).

In short:
Property	Meaning	Ensures
Atomicity	All or nothing	No partial updates
Consistency	Valid state transitions	Data integrity
Isolation	Independent execution	No interference
Durability	Permanent results	Crash safety
