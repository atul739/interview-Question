🧩 Transaction Isolation Levels in Java
🔹 What is an Isolation Level?
	• Isolation is one of the ACID properties of a transaction.
	• It defines how much one transaction is isolated from other concurrent transactions.
	• It controls how and when the changes made by one operation become visible to others.

⚙️ Isolation Levels (from weakest to strongest)
Isolation Level	Description	Problems Prevented	Problems Possible
1️⃣ READ_UNCOMMITTED	Transactions can read uncommitted (dirty) data from other transactions.	❌ Prevents nothing	❌ Dirty Read, ❌ Non-Repeatable Read, ❌ Phantom Read
2️⃣ READ_COMMITTED	A transaction can only read data that’s already committed.	✅ Prevents Dirty Reads	❌ Non-Repeatable Read, ❌ Phantom Read
3️⃣ REPEATABLE_READ	Ensures same row read multiple times will return the same data, even if other transactions modify it.	✅ Prevents Dirty & Non-Repeatable Reads	❌ Phantom Read
4️⃣ SERIALIZABLE	Highest level — transactions execute sequentially as if one after another.	✅ Prevents Dirty, Non-Repeatable, Phantom Reads	❌ Very slow (locks entire table)

🧠 Common Transaction Problems Explained
Problem	Description	Example
Dirty Read	Reading uncommitted data from another transaction	T1 updates a row but hasn’t committed → T2 reads it
Non-Repeatable Read	Same query gives different results in same transaction	T1 reads a row, T2 updates it → T1 reads again, value changed
Phantom Read	Same query returns different number of rows	T1 reads all rows, T2 inserts new row → T1 reads again, extra row appears

⚙️ How Isolation Levels Work in Java (Spring / JDBC)
✅ Using Spring Boot / Spring Transactional
You can set isolation levels using @Transactional annotation:

@Transactional(isolation = Isolation.READ_COMMITTED)
public void updateAccount() {
    // business logic here
}
Supported Constants:

Isolation.READ_UNCOMMITTED
Isolation.READ_COMMITTED
Isolation.REPEATABLE_READ
Isolation.SERIALIZABLE

✅ Default Isolation Level
Database	Default Isolation
Oracle	READ_COMMITTED
MySQL (InnoDB)	REPEATABLE_READ
PostgreSQL	READ_COMMITTED
SQL Server	READ_COMMITTED

🧩 Performance vs Consistency Trade-off
Level	Consistency	Performance
READ_UNCOMMITTED	❌ Low	⚡ High
READ_COMMITTED	⚖️ Moderate	⚡ High
REPEATABLE_READ	✅ High	🐢 Slower
SERIALIZABLE	✅ Highest	🐢 Slowest

💡 Interview Summary Answer:
	“Isolation level defines how transactions interact with each other.
	Java supports four main levels — READ_UNCOMMITTED, READ_COMMITTED, REPEATABLE_READ, and SERIALIZABLE.
	As you go up, consistency increases but performance decreases.
	Typically, READ_COMMITTED is used as a balance between data safety and performance.”
